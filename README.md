# open-diffusion-motion-brush
An Open Implementation of Motion Brush like Gen-2

Work in progress...ðŸš§

For those who want to try simple demo or want to figure out my trick to make the motion brush, I put the minimum code under the repository [motion_brush_minimum_code](motion_brush_minimum_code). It is quite simple and easy to understand.

## Installation
First install the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) according to your device.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cplusx/open-diffusion-motion-brush.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Functions TODO list
- [] Mask dilation
- [] Set number of time steps to do replacement
