# open-diffusion-motion-brush
This Is An Open Implementation of Motion Brush like Gen-2
Motion Brush allows you to specify the region of image to have motion.
This implementation is based on 
* [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)
* [Stable Video Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/using-diffusers/svd) by Stabilityai

ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ Try it in Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/cplusx/4fbe79162880cd007cdca39389b3c4a4/open_motion_brush.ipynb)

## Introduction
Steps to have your image to be moving/animated:
1. Upload your image
2. Use the sketch brush to specify the region to have motion
3. [Optinoal] Adjust the parameters, the motion bucket ID will affect the motion strength (the larger the stronger)
4. Click "Generate" to see the result

Work in progress...ðŸš§

For those who want to try simple demo or want to figure out my trick to make the motion brush, I put the minimum code under the repository [motion_brush_minimum_code](motion_brush_minimum_code). It is quite simple and easy to understand.

## Installation
First install the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) according to your device.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cplusx/open-diffusion-motion-brush.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use
Start the demo by running:
```bash
python gradio_demo.py
```

The following GIF shows how to use the motion brush to specify the region to have motion. 

(Note, the GIF removes the processing frames, it takes ~2 mins on a V100 for 25x576x1024 video.)

Functions TODO list
- [] Mask dilation
- [] Google Colab Demo
- [x] Handle image resizing if the input image is too large or does not satisfy the requirement
- [x] Set number of time steps to do replacement
